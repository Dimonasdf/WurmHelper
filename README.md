# WurmHelper

A little tool to help you with repetitive clicking.

Select quantity of loops and actions. Determine and specify the duration and "Craft"/"Continue" (or other) button location, and this tool with move your mouse to continue your crafting just in time when your stamina comes back. Useful if you want to do some other stuff while crafting, or if you are managing several windows. Launch your game in windowed mode, of course.

Tool will target location on your primary display, so move your game there. If you are really looking for multi-monitor setup, create an issue here, or contact me elsewhere, and I'll try to implement it. Happy crafting!
